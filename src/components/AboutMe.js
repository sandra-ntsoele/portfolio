            I am an aspiring 'self taught' developer. Who first learned the basics of programming with Java but quickly moved away from that after developing an interest in web development.
         </p>
         <p>
            I started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript, created a few horrendous looking websites and later on a friend introduced to Node.js/express and a little MongoDB.
         </p>
         <p>
            More recently I have been learning the .NET stack as an attempt to get the necessary skills to land a dev job opportunity and achieve the goal of being a full-stack developer.
